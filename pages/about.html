                    <p>Guess the colours.</p>
                    <p>In <i>Beginner</i>, you will play 4 possible colours and 10 attempts. </p><br>
                    <p>In <i>Intermediate</i>, you will have 5 colours to choose from and 8 attempts.</p><br>
                    <p>In <i>Advanced</i>, you will have 6 colours to combine and 6 attempts.</p><br>
                    <p>With the available colours you must try combinations until you find the solution.</p>
                    <p>When you press the check button you will see how many colours</p>
                    <p>you have found in the correct spot (marked with purple balls)</p>
                    <p>and how many colours you got right, but in the wrong spot (marked with white balls).</p><br>
                    <p>If you waste all attempts you will die.</p><br>
